# Python-Facial-Emotion-Recognition-Fer-2013
A machine learning project from UVic SENG-474 course, using python with .ipynb type file developed and modified the CNN model and Resnet model. This project conducts training and testing based on fer-2013 Dataset to predict the emotion of the face in the pictures.

Handled data pre-processing and cleanup using pandas and numpy to establish training pipeline 

The folder 'Test' and 'Train' contain the images of people faces with 7 classes of emotion.

The file CNN-custom-model.ipynb is python notebook file which comes with the outputs of each block (also for other ipynb files)

The 'val_accuracy: ' is the final test accuracy value.
